- Optimized the Greenfield Benchmark framework, integrating key metrics for improved CAPEX project comparisons.

### Cost Consultant (Data Analsyis focus) @ Cleopatra Enterprise (Jan 2023 - Present)
- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis the cost data for more than 10 000 equipment used in Oil and Gas industry, impacting of over 10 000 cost models.
- Applied supervised deep learning approaches to developing a Deep learning Python cost model to predict the cost of valves based on few training data.
- Data-Driven Cost models with Decision Trees

#### Highlight Project(s)
#### Cost of Valves based on Desicion Trees Project
Developed objective strategy for predicting the cost of valves using Python. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the type of valves. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key cost and possibly discovering new cost drivers.

Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
Publication

Used Python to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated the cost of valves based on a suite of over 30 variables. We found variables can be used to accurately estimate the cost with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring steel conditions measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
